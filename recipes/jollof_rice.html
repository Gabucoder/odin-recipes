     <p>Jollof rice is a flavorful and vibrant West African dish made with long-grain rice cooked in a rich, spicy tomato-based sauce. It combines tomatoes, onions, peppers, and a mix of aromatic spices to create its signature taste and color. The dish is known for its smoky, slightly sweet, and savory flavors, often enhanced with chicken or vegetable broth. Jollof rice is typically served as a main dish, accompanied by sides like fried plantains, grilled chicken, fish, or a fresh salad. Its bold taste and versatility make it a celebrated meal across many African countries.</p>
