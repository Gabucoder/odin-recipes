    <p>Minestrone casserole is a hearty, baked twist on the classic Italian soup. It combines pasta, beans, and a medley of vegetables like zucchini, carrots, and tomatoes, often enriched with garlic and Italian herbs. The ingredients are layered or mixed with a flavorful tomato sauce and sometimes a creamy component like cheese or b√©chamel. Topped with shredded cheese or breadcrumbs, the casserole is baked until bubbly and golden. This comforting dish captures the essence of minestrone while adding the satisfying texture of a baked casserole, making it a perfect choice for a wholesome family meal.</p>
